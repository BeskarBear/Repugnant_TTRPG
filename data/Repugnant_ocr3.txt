Repugnant is everything the name suggests. It’s a gross game. Part of the
fun of the game is being gross. Repugnant focuses on body humor, trash, rot,
mutations, and a mild level of body horror at default. However, our team
draws a strong line between gross and dehumanizing. Racism, facism, bigotry,
and other items that treat people as objects or certain groups of people

Dwellers come in a vast range of shapes, sizes, colors,
and smells, but since most of them split off of a common

ancestral Kinfolk a long time ago everyone tends to get

along. Any small to medium sized town will have a mix of
Hoggos, Vermals, Roachers, and Meatsacks. Even the recent
appearance of JunkPunx didn’t throw folks for a loop.

Like the Eyeballer, the Digithingi is yet
another example of the. extreme nature of the crusts' mutagenic properties. This time though
we have the subterranean version. Whereas
Byeballers rely totally on Sight and are near

hairless, the Digithingi is blind, covered in

coarse hair, and navigates the crust by feel.

"Ysing its powerful arms and jaws Digithingis
will loosen then shovel the loam into their

rouths, tunneling at a high speed. The barely
chewed bite of terra firma is digested in an
instant and transformed into a horrendous gas.

This gas then released, propelling the

Digithingi like a cannonball. Roachers and

Nothing on the Crust is more infamous
or singularly feared than
the Yechey. Every extreme of filthiness is
personified by this being
of pure unyielding nastiness. Using its palatable
stench, excellent

sniffling Yechey tracks
its prey endlessly. It's stench is otherworld

assert that these are a surviving species of insect
from the ancient world but grown unnaturally

The Phelmite stone is a decroded schnose shaped, booger grown
large over many centuries and many layers of snot hardening

into a dense stone like substance. It is fabled to be the very

essence of all Phlegm on the crust, perhaps the universe and
is

almost certainly the patron of all Slimoores. A shard of the
Phlegmite stone is said to carry mucus magic that can fetch a

high price and grants its owner powers untold. If undisturbed,

the Phlegmite Stone will lie dormant but if awoken will

conjure

a frightening forn, spewing mucus from its enlarged
nostrils,

until it congeals into a towering mass of sticky, slippery,

pointy and snotty slime. If that wasn't scary enough, once
