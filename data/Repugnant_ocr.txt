Some of us have gotten a little weird. Mutations are pretty common

on The Crust. An extra eye, another mouth, the ability to control
mucus with your mind, it happens when your bodies are constantly
exposed to garbage, filth, and a low level of radiation. Most folks
who get mutations end up helping folks out, but some folks take
advantage for their own ends.

Red means something is off limits. It could be something that

know to avoid these topics narratively. You are not required

Dwellers come in a vast range of shapes, sizes, colors,
and smells, but since most of them split off of a common
ancestral Kinfolk a long time ago everyone tends to get

along. Any small to medium sized town will have a mix of
Hoggos, Vermals, Roachers, and Meatsacks. Even the recent
appearance of JunkPunx didn’t throw folks for a loop.

Threat is the target number you need to throw at or over when
attempting to attack, threaten, or influence these creatures

successfully. If your Points match this number you do 1 hit, if you
double that number you hit twice, if you triple that number you hit
thrice, and so on. ‘this is also the number you must throw at or
above when defending yourself from these creatures.

Hits represents the general health and fortitude of the creature.

Like the Eyeballer, the Digithingi is yet
another example of the. extreme nature of the crusts' mutagenic properties. This time though
we have the subterranean version. Whereas
Byeballers rely totally on Sight and are near

hairless, the Digithingi is klind, covered in

coarse hair, and navigates the crust by feel.
“Using its powerful arms and jaws Digithingis
will loosen then shovel the loam into their

rouths, tunneling at a high speed. The barely
chewed bite of terra firma is digested in an

instant and transformed into a horrendous gas.
This gas then released, propelling the
Digithingi like a cannonball. Roachers and

Vernals are known to sometimes wrangle and
ride a Digithingi, grasping into its odorous
tress of hair as it butt blasts through
underground. tunnels and sewer pipes.

For every towering spire of trash littered about
the Crust there is a teaming subterranean colony of
overgrown insects Dwellers call GiAnts. Scholars
assert that these are a surviving species of insect
from the ancient world but grown unnaturally
large. It's not common but some brave Dwellers have
actually managed to tame, befriend then mount
GiAnts, harnessing their incredible strength,
crushing mandibles, natural tunneling power and
surefooted climbing skills. GiAnts if left alone, are
typically harmless, mostly minding the needs of

their colony. If not handled with great reverence
and caution, GiAnts have been known to rip a
meddlesome dweller in twain scuttling off to their
Ant-Fill to feed the queen their remains. Many
Dwellers warn that the GiAnts must be closely
monitored for fear that if their number
s grow,

they may supplant Dwellers as the dominant
Species on the Crust. Until then,
they might

The Phelmite stone is a decroded schnose shaped, booger grown

large over many centuries and many layers of snot hardening

into a dense stone like substance. It is fabled to be the very
essence of all Phlegm on the crust, perhaps the universe and is
almost certainly the patron of all Slimoores. A shard of the
Phlegmite stone is said to carry mucus magic that can fetch a
high price and grants its owner powers untold. If undisturbed,
the Phlegmite Stone will lie dormant but if awoken will conjure

a frightening form, spewing mucus from its enlarged nostrils,
until it congeals into a towering mass of sticky, slippery,

pointy and snotty slime. If that wasn't scary enough, once the
Phlegmite Stone has taken the Form of the Booger Boss it can
flick hunks of itself at attackers known as Phlegmings.

Phlegmings are basically creatures in their own right, able to
fight and defend the Phlegmite stone until they're reabsorbed.
